Instead of facts, we have colorful stories, speculation, conjecture, and plain old fiction. Telling one from the other is easier said than done. The Ragdoll was developed in the 1960s by the late Ann Baker of Riverside, California. In fact, who, where, and when are just about the only details involving the breed\u2019s origins that are not subject to debate. The foundation cat from which the breed originated, Josephine, was a semi-feral longhaired white female of unknown parentage. Despite Ann Baker\u2019s colorful stories, it\u2019s likely that the foundation cat possessed some exceptional genes, either recessive or masked by her dominant white color, allowing for some striking offspring. These striking offspring, in particular a mitted sealpoint longhaired male with a white blaze and a white tail tip named Daddy Warbucks, became the foundation of the Ragdoll breed.\n\nIn 1971, Ann Baker trademarked the name Ragdoll, and after years of selective breeding, the Ragdoll developed into the breed known today. It took many years of effort to overcome the strange tales and controversies behind the breed, but with the Ragdoll\u2019s hard-won CFA championship status granted in February 2000, the breed was finally recognized for championship by every major North American cat association. The Ragdoll has earned a place in the spotlight, just as this cat has earned a place in the laps and hearts of people everywhere.\n\nRead more...\nPhysical Attributes\nBODY\nLarge and long, broad and solid, with heavy boning.
